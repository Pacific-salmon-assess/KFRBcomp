A wide variety of estimation approaches have been developed, from simple to complex, and some worthwhile methodologies and auxiliary data are underutilized. The types and quality of the data available determine the most appropriate assessment methodology and the reliability of the assessment results. The management strategies available and the performance of these strategies are likewise highly dependent on the available data. This review gives an overview of the range of assessment methodologies, from the ad-hoc to hierarchical Bayesian state-space approaches. It emphasizes the central role of data; data types, data deficiencies, auxiliary information such as environmental indices, habitat characteristics, and similar stocks, and the effects of the data on the quality of guidance to managers.},

  abstract = {Significance             Black swans\textemdash statistically improbable events with profound consequences\textemdash happen more often than expected in financial, social, and natural systems. Our work demonstrates the rare but systematic presence of black-swan events in animal populations around the world (mostly birds, mammals, and insects). These events are predominantly downward, implying that unexpected population crashes occur more frequently than increases. Black-swan events are not driven by life history (e.g., lifespan) but by external causes such as extreme winters and disease. Ignoring the presence of downward black swans may severely underestimate extinction risk in animal populations, particularly under a changing climate, where such extreme events are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude.           ,                             Black swans are improbable events that nonetheless occur\textemdash often with profound consequences. Such events drive important transitions in social systems (e.g., banking collapses) and physical systems (e.g., earthquakes), and yet it remains unclear the extent to which ecological population numbers buffer or suffer from such extremes. Here, we estimate the prevalence and direction of black-swan events (heavy-tailed process noise) in 609 animal populations after accounting for population dynamics (productivity, density dependence, and typical stochasticity). We find strong evidence for black-swan events in                                                   {$\sim$}                                               4\% of populations. These events occur most frequently for birds (7\%), mammals (5\%), and insects (3\%) and are not explained by any life-history covariates but tend to be driven by external perturbations such as climate, severe winters, predators, parasites, or the combined effect of multiple factors. Black-swan events manifest primarily as population die-offs and crashes (86\%) rather than unexpected increases, and ignoring heavy-tailed process noise leads to an underestimate in the magnitude of population crashes. We suggest modelers consider heavy-tailed, downward-skewed probability distributions, such as the skewed Student                                                   t                                               used here, when making forecasts of population abundance. Our results demonstrate the importance of both modeling heavy-tailed downward events in populations, and developing conservation strategies that are robust to ecological surprises.},

The close correspondence in the persistence of climate trends and the synchrony of the changes is evidence that a common event may cause the regime shifts. The trends or regimes can be characterized by stable means in physical data series or multiyear periods of linked recruitment patterns in fish populations. The regime concept is important in fisheries management because the natural shifts in abundance may be large and sudden, requiring that these natural impacts be distinguished from fishing effects. An equally important consideration is that biological and physical mechanisms may change when regimes shift, resulting in conditions that may not be characterized in the earlier part of the data series. Fluctuations in Pacific salmon abundance in this century were synchronous with large fluctuations in Japanese sardine abundance, which can be traced back to the early 1600's. The synchrony in the fluctuations suggests that Pacific salmon abundance may have fluctuated for centuries in response to trends in climate. The concept of regimes and regime shifts stresses the need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of fish and their ecosystems.},

Here we tested for time-varying trends in biological productivity parameters across 262 fish stocks of 127 species in 39 large marine ecosystems and high-seas areas (hereafter LMEs). This global meta-analysis revealed widespread changes in the relationship between spawning stock size and the production of juvenile offspring (recruitment), suggesting fundamental biological change in fish stock productivity at early life stages. Across regions, we estimate that average recruitment capacity has declined at a rate approximately equal to 3\% of the historical maximum per decade. However, we observed large variability among stocks and regions; for example, highly negative trends in the North Atlantic contrast with more neutral patterns in the North Pacific. The extent of biological change in each LME was significantly related to observed changes in phytoplankton chlorophyll concentration and the intensity of historical overfishing in that ecosystem. We conclude that both environmental changes and chronic overfishing have already affected the productive capacity of many stocks at the recruitment stage of the life cycle. These results provide a baseline for ecosystem-based fisheries management and may help adjust expectations for future food production from the oceans.},

It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

These stocks experienced low abundance in the 1990s, which led to declarations of economic disaster and calls for changes in harvest strategies. Our stochastic model provides decision makers with quantitative information about trade-offs among commercial harvest, subsistence harvest, and spawner abundance. The model included outcome uncertainty (the difference between target and realized spawner abundances) in the subsistence and commercial catch modules. We also used closed-loop simulations to investigate the utility of time-varying management policies in which target spawner abundance changed in response to changes in the Ricker productivity parameter (a), as estimated with a Kalman filter. Time-varying policies resulted in higher escapements and catches and reduced risk across a range of harvest rates. The resulting generic risk-assessment framework can be used to evaluate harvest guidelines for most salmon stocks.},

Using data from 47 North American sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations, we present evidence that the magnitude and direction of climate and competition effects vary over large spatial scales. In the south, a warm ocean and abundant salmon competitors combined to strongly reduce sockeye productivity, whereas in the north, a warm ocean substantially increased productivity and offset the negative effects of competition at sea. From 2005 to 2015, the approximately 82 million adult pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) produced annually from hatcheries were estimated to have reduced the productivity of southern sockeye salmon by ϳ15\%, on average. In contrast, for sockeye at the northwestern end of their range, the same level of hatchery production was predicted to have reduced the positive effects of a warming ocean by ϳ50\% (from a ϳ10\% to a ϳ5\% increase in productivity, on average). These findings reveal spatially dependent effects of climate and competition on sockeye productivity and highlight the need for international discussions about large-scale hatchery production.},

To address this gap, we assembled a vast database of survival and other data for eight wild populations of threatened Chinook salmon (               O. tshawytscha               ). For each population, we evaluated climate impacts at all life stages and modeled future trajectories forced by global climate model projections. Populations rapidly declined in response to increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors across diverse model assumptions and climate scenarios. Strong density dependence limited the number of salmon that survived early life stages, suggesting a potentially efficacious target for conservation effort. Other solutions require a better understanding of the factors that limit survival at sea. We conclude that dramatic increases in smolt survival are needed to overcome the negative impacts of climate change for this threatened species.},

Traditional methods for defining these goals relied on stock\textendash recruitment analysis; however, this approach often ignores three fundamental sources of uncertainty: estimation error, implementation uncertainty, and time-varying recruitment dynamics.

Results indicate (i) implementation uncertainty can be reasonably approximated with simple rules reflecting fishery managers' daily decision process; (ii) despite implementation uncertainty, escapement goals are likely to be realized or exceeded, on average; and (iii) management strategies targeting escapement levels estimated by traditional methods to produce maximum sustainable yield may result in lower catch and greater variability in fishing opportunity compared with a strategy with defining high and low escapement goals that are targeted depending on assessed run size, which may maximize future catch while reducing the frequency of extremely low harvests.},

  abstract = {We used empirically based simulation modelling of 48 sockeye salmon (O. nerka) populations to examine how reliably alternative monitoring designs and fish stock assessment methods can distinguish between changes in density-dependent versus density-independent components of productivity and identify the relative contribution of a climate-driven covariate. We explored a wide range of scenarios for ocean and freshwater conditions and the response of salmon productivity (adult recruits per spawner) to those conditions. Our results show that stock assessments based on historical relationships between salmon productivity and climate-driven oceanographic conditions will likely perform poorly when those relationships change, even when such changes are anticipated and incorporated into stock assessment models in a timely manner. Estimating the relative importance of climate-driven oceanographic influences as a driver of sockeye productivity will be difficult, especially if climatic changes occur rapidly and concurrently with other disturbances. Thus, better understanding of the mechanisms by which climatic changes and other drivers influence salmon productivity may be essential to avoid undesirable management outcomes. As well, an expansion of monitoring of juvenile salmon abundances on more salmon stocks is needed to help distinguish the effects of different drivers.}

However, detecting such trends is difficult because observation error and natural variability in survival rates tend to obscure underlying trends. A Kalman filter estimation procedure has previously been shown to be effective in such situations. We used it on a Ricker spawner\textendash recruit model to reconstruct indices of annual productivity (recruits per spawner (R/S) at low spawner abundance) based on historical data for 120 stocks of pink ( Oncorhynchus gorbuscha ), chum ( Oncorhynchus keta ), and sockeye ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) salmon. These stocks were from Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. The resulting estimated temporal trends in productivity show large changes (on average 60\%\textendash 70\% differences in R/S and average ratios of highest to lowest R/S between 5.4 and 7.9 for the three species). Such changes suggest that salmon stock assessment methods should take into account possible nonstationarity. This step will help provide scientific advice to help managers to meet conservation and management objectives. The Kalman filter results also identified some stocks that did not share temporal trends with other stocks; these exceptions may require special monitoring and management efforts.},

Therefore, it is important to consider practical and effective ways to incorporate CC into fisheries advice so that the advice can be considered conditioned to CC. We developed a model to characterise the empirical relationship between a variable affected by climate and fish production. We then used model projections as a foundation for a risk analysis of CC effects on harvesting of Greenland halibut               Reinhardtius hippoglossoides               in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. The risk-based approach quantified a) the relative change in risk of a status quo fishing strategy under various CC scenarios, and b) the change in fishery exploitation rates required to achieve a management objective over a specified time period at a level of risk considered acceptable (risk equivalent fishery exploitation advice). This empirical approach can be used to develop risk-based advice for any other external variable that affects stock production in addition to climate-related variables and it can be applied in most situations where there is an index of stock biomass and fisheries catch. Shifting the focus from process-based understanding of the responses of fish stocks to CC to quantification of how CC-contributed uncertainty can alter the risks associated with different fishing strategies and/or management options, can ensure timely delivery of robust scientific advice for fisheries under non-stationary environmental conditions.},

Fishing gear and fishing season times selected for fish differing in life history strategies. Temporal variation in life histories reflected changes in both fisheries and the changing environment. There was an inverse relationship between years spent in fresh water and sea age. Biocomplexity was manifested by the multiple year classes (6\textendash 11) present in annual runs, which increased with years, reflecting an increase both in previous spawners and sampling effort. The high number of cohorts spawning simultaneously each year indicates strong generational overlap, which has been suggested to maintain genetic diversity and thereby resilience via the portfolio effect.},

In exploited systems, however, management goals to preserve diversity may be in tension with harvest objectives. For example, fisheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of fisheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a Pacific salmon stock aggregate and its fishery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries influences management performance. We focused on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon fisheries. Additionally, we examined how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock fisheries may change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We found that increasing single-stock fishery allocations increased aggregate abundance and improved the status of some stocks relative to their conservation benchmarks. However, these improvements did not occur uniformly\textendash relatively abundant, productive stocks exhibited no change, or even declines, in conservation performance as single-stock fishery allocations increased. Furthermore, differences in performance between mixed- and single-stock fisheries were reduced when productivity was uniformly low, when the mixedstock fishery was managed conservatively, or when mortality during freshwater migrations was high. While single-stock fisheries can increase the probability that conservation-based objectives will be met, they are not a panacea and may only be effective when specific conditions are met.},

  abstract = {The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) goal is ``to restore and maintain healthy salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity'' (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2005). In order to achieve this goal, the WSP outlines a number of strategies, including `Strategy 1: standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses', which is the subject of this paper. In the current paper, Fraser Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs) from `WSP Action Step 1.1: the identification of conservation units' are used to update `Action Step 1.2: the development of criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to represent biological statuses', and to address `Action Step 1.3: CU status assessment', for the 22 current CUs and two de novo `CUs'. Using a previously developed toolkit for CU status assessment (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), abundance benchmarks (unique to each CU) were estimated for each CU with stock-recruitment data, and trends in abundance upper and lower benchmarks (common across all CUs) were modified to apply to Fraser Sockeye. These benchmarks were used to delineate the three WSP biological status zones (Red, Amber, and Green). Abundance benchmarks were estimated across a range of stock-recruitment models, including the standard Ricker model that assumes constant productivity and other Ricker model forms that assume time varying productivity. Consideration of time varying productivity in the estimation of abundance benchmarks was important since most Fraser Sockeye CUs have exhibited systematic declines in productivity over recent decades (Grant et al. 2011) and extirpation risk can increase when a CUs productivity is linearly decreasing or low (Holt 2009; Holt and Bradford 2011). Abundance benchmarks were also estimated across a range of probability levels to reflect uncertainty in the estimation process. Estimates of a CU's spawner abundances at maximum juvenile production (Smax) were also updated and used as carrying capacity priors in Ricker models, where available and appropriate. In the evaluation of status using the abundance metric, both the geometric and arithmetic means of the recent CU abundance were compared against benchmarks. Since multiple metrics (one abundance and three trends in abundance metrics, depending on the CU) and uncertainty in abundance benchmarks are presented in the current paper, statuses for a single CU can comprise all three WSP status zones. Status integration will be explored in future processes and publications.},

Although most of these Fraser Sockeye case studies represent data rich CUs in the Pacific Region, with long time series of stock-recruitment data, a few CUs are also data limited (e.g. Chilliwack-ES only has some recent spawner abundance data). Status integration was evaluated during a three day technical workshop, which included the development of both final integrated status for each Fraser Sockeye CU (which include one or more WSP status zones) and commentaries on the information used to assess status. For the workshop, two page standardized data summaries were produced for each Fraser Sockeye CU case study. Data summaries included WSP biological status information for a number of metrics (e.g. relative abundance, short-term trends in abundance, and long-term trends in abundance) and other biological data relevant to their interpretation. Case studies were evaluated `blind', with generic labels rather than CU names. The decision to evaluate case studies `blind' was made to facilitate the development of a standardized WSP status integration approach, to focus discussion on the metrics presented in Grant et al. (2011) for status integration, and to facilitate discussion between experts with detailed local and CU-specific knowledge and those with broader salmonid and status evaluation experience. Each CU case study was evaluated first in small group sessions (four to six participants per group) and, subsequently, in plenary sessions (all 34 workshop participants). On the final day of the workshop, the integrated status for each CU, developed in the previous days' plenary sessions, were re-visited with the goal to narrow down a CU's status to a final single status zone (where possible), and to fine tune commentaries. Also on the final day of the workshop, CU names were revealed to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific supplementary information that might support a change in integrated status designation or that could be added to the CU status commentaries. Integrated status results from this workshop complete WSP status determinations for Fraser Sockeye, which follows up on the recently published exploration of uncertainty in WSP status metrics for these CUs. Final statuses for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs included the following: seven Red, four Red/Amber, four Amber, two Amber/Green, five Green, one ``Data Deficient'', and one ``Undetermined''. Detailed status results amongst groups and expert commentary (which identified key metrics and associated data that guided these status determinations) are also summarized, and are necessary for CU status interpretation in WSP Strategy 4: Integrated Strategic Planning. Although each group moved through the CU summary information in different sequences, there was considerable similarity amongst groups regarding which considerations drove their final status determinations},

We evaluate the evidence that fishing is causing evolutionary changes to traits including body size, migration timing and age of maturation, and we discuss the implications for fisheries and conservation. Few studies have fully evaluated the ingredients of fisheries-induced evolution: selection intensity, genetic variability, correlation among traits under selection, and response to selection. Most studies are limited in their ability to separate genetic responses from phenotypic plasticity, and environmental change complicates interpretation. However, strong evidence for selection intensity and for genetic variability in salmon fitness traits indicates that fishing can cause detectable evolution within ten or fewer generations. Evolutionary issues are therefore meaningful considerations in salmon fishery management. Evolutionary biologists have rarely been involved in the development of salmon fishing policy, yet evolutionary biology is relevant to the long-term success of fisheries. Future management might consider fishing policy to (i) allow experimental testing of evolutionary responses to exploitation and (ii) improve the long-term sustainability of the fishery by mitigating unfavorable evolutionary responses to fishing. We provide suggestions for how this might be done.},

This paper illustrates the distinction between biological benchmarks and management reference points with a case study on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). In Canada, the management and assessment of wild Pacific salmon are guided by a major 2005 conservation policy, which calls for the identification of biological benchmarks to categorize status of demographically isolated populations, and decision-support tools, such as management reference points, to integrate biological information with appropriate social and economic information. In the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), the selection of management reference points for sockeye salmon (O. nerka) fisheries explicitly considered trade-offs between the probability of meeting long-term biological objectives on component populations and harvest objectives on population aggregates. Decisions about reference points were made in a consultative process that included extensive stakeholder engagement. Other agencies are urged to distinguish biological benchmarks from management reference points to ensure transparency in the relative influence of biological versus socioeconomic information in decision making.},

  abstract = {Status assessments for Chum Salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) have been limited, in part because recruitment time-series required to calculate stock- recruitment based benchmarks are not consistently available. Alternative benchmarks have been proposed for data-limited Conservation Units (CUs) using percentiles of the observed spawner abundance time-series. However, these benchmarks have not been evaluated against stock-recruitment benchmarks currently used to assess status on abundances for data-rich CUs. Our goals were to evaluate percentile-based benchmarks against stock-recruitment based benchmarks accounting for high uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates, and age-at-maturity. We used two approaches to evaluate benchmarks based on a retrospective comparison through the historical record and a prospective simulation model under numerous hypothetical future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach for providing assessments that accounts for uncertainties in benchmarks, and provide advice on the applicability of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon relative to stock-recruitment benchmarks used for data-rich CUs. In general, our results support the application of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high ({$>$}2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate ({$\leq$}40\%). However, we suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks (and the consideration of alternatives) when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. Under these conditions, concurrent declines in abundances and percentile benchmarks can results in status assessments that are more optimistic than those from stock-recruitment benchmarks due to shifting baselines.},

Two benchmarks will be used to place populations in one of three abundance categories. The lower benchmark is proposed to be at a level that allows for a substantial buffer between it and the abundance that would result in a population's being assessed as at risk of extirpation based on quantitative criteria used by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we evaluated eight candidate lower benchmarks calculated from parameters of the stock\textendash recruit relationship against two criteria, the probability of extirpation over 100 years and the probability of recovery to spawner abundances that result in the maximum sustainable yield in one or three generations. For modeled populations of moderate size (unfished equilibrium abundances {$>$}25,000) and moderate productivity ({$\sim$}four adult recruits produced per spawner at low spawner abundances), all benchmarks protected populations from extirpation when harvest restrictions were imposed at the lower benchmark. For small or unproductive populations, none of the benchmarks was adequate to prevent populations from being at risk of extirpation. However, those benchmarks that covaried with the productivity parameter of the stock\textendash recruitment relationship performed better and are preferred to those that were derived mainly from estimates of habitat capacity.},

Ignoring trends in productivity led to overestimates of productivity and underestimates of capacity when both exploitation rates and productivity declined over time, resulting in an underestimation on average of benchmarks of biological status. Despite being less biased, time-varying models had relatively poor fit based on AICc and BIC model selection criteria. Our simulation results were compared with empirical analyses of 12 Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia, Canada. Although benchmarks were less biased when based on time-varying models, underlying true benchmarks based on spawner abundances at maximum sustainable yield, SMSY, trend downwards when productivity declines, which may not be aligned with conservation objectives.

Will depleted populations of Pacific salmon recover under persistent reductions in survival and catastrophic mortality events? \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 2018\textendash 2026. Under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, benchmarks between zones of biological status are required to distinguish populations requiring conservation attention (Red and Amber zones) from those that can be managed for production (Green zone). The recovery of depleted populations (i.e. from Red to Green) will depend in part on the choice of the lower benchmark. At a minimum, that benchmark should be set high enough to allow recovery within an acceptable time-frame in the absence of targeted fishing. Currently, benchmarks are evaluated and selected using simulation models that assess the probability of recovery to spawner abundance associated with the maximum sustainable yield within a specified time-frame. Guided by case examples, the evaluation is extended to include two scenarios of future conditions: persistent reductions in survival rates below the replacement level; and increased frequency of catastrophic mortality (die-off) events. Probabilities of recovery appear to be more sensitive to persistent reductions in survival than to increased probability of die-off events. The current lower benchmarks on spawner abundance and fishing mortality might not be sufficiently precautionary to allow recovery under those conditions.},

  abstract = {The ecosystems supporting Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are changing rapidly as a result of climate change and habitat alteration. Understanding how\textemdash and how consistently\textemdash salmon populations respond to changes at regional and watershed scales has major implications for fisheries management and habitat conservation. Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) populations across Alaska have declined over the past decade, resulting in fisheries closures and prolonged impacts to local communities. These declines are associated with large-scale climate drivers, but uncertainty remains about the role of local conditions (e.g., precipitation, streamflow, and stream temperature) that vary among the watersheds where salmon spawn and rear. We estimated the effects of these and other environmental indicators on the productivity of 15 Chinook salmon populations in the Cook Inlet basin, southcentral Alaska, using a hierarchical Bayesian stock-recruitment model. Salmon spawning during 2003\textendash 2007 produced 57\% fewer recruits than the previous long-term average, leading to declines in adult returns beginning in 2008. These declines were explained in part by density dependence, with reduced population productivity following years of high spawning abundance. Across all populations, productivity declined with increased precipitation during the fall spawning and early incubation period and increased with above-average precipitation during juvenile rearing. Above-average stream temperatures during spawning and rearing had variable effects, with negative relationships in many warmer streams and positive relationships in some colder streams. Productivity was also associated with regional indices of streamflow and ocean conditions, with high variability among populations. The cumulative effects of adverse conditions in freshwater, including high spawning abundance, heavy fall rains, and hot, dry summers may have contributed to the recent population declines across the region. Identifying both coherent and differential responses to environmental change underscores the importance of targeted, watershed-specific monitoring and conservation efforts for maintaining resilient salmon runs in a warming world.},

Within the conservation context, fisheries-induced evolution has been hypothesized to negatively affect the persistence and recovery potential of depleted populations, but this has not been explicitly investigated. Here, we investigate how fisheries-induced evolution of Atlantic cod (               Gadus morhua               L.) life histories affects               per capita               population growth rate, a parameter negatively correlated with extinction risk. We simulate the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of a cod population for a 100 year period of size-selective harvesting, followed thereafter by 300 years of recovery. To evaluate the relative importance of harvest-induced evolution, we either allowed life histories to evolve during and after the fishing period, or we assumed that fisheries-induced evolution was absent. Population growth rates did not differ appreciably between the evolutionary and non-evolutionary simulation scenarios, despite the emergence of rather pronounced differences in life histories. The underlying reason was that in the absence of fishing the cumulative lifetime reproductive outputs were very similar among differing life histories. The results suggest that fisheries-induced evolution might not always have as clear-cut an effect on population growth rate as previously anticipated.},

British Columbia and Washington salmon showed either neutral responses to temperature (pink), negative responses that weakened after 1988\textendash 1989 (sockeye), or a switch from neutral to negative responses (chum).

In this study, we investigated whether variability in two North Pacific Current (NPC) indices was associated with changes in productivity of North American Pacific salmon stocks. Specifically, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the effects of the north-south location of the NPC bifurcation (BI) and the NPC strength, indexed by the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), on the productivity of 163 pink, chum, and sockeye salmon stocks. We found that for salmon stocks located in Washington (WA) and British Columbia (BC), both the BI and NPGO had significant positive effects on productivity, indicating that a northward-shifted bifurcation and a stronger NPC are associated with increased salmon productivity. For the WA and BC regions, the estimated NPGO effect was over two times larger than the BI effect for pink and chum salmon, whereas for sockeye salmon the BI effect was 2.4 times higher than the NPGO. In contrast to WA and BC stocks, we found weak effects of both horizontal ocean transport processes on the productivity of salmon stocks in Alaska. Our results indicated that horizontal transport pathways might strongly influence population dynamics of Pacific salmon in the southern part of their North American ranges, but not the northern part, suggesting that different environmental pathways may underlie changes in salmon productivity in northern and southern areas for the species under consideration.},

To address this knowledge gap, we employed restriction site associated DNA sequencing to conduct the first genomic study of all major populations of CV Chinook salmon.

Additionally, we show evidence for differentiation and adaptation within migratory phenotypes despite high levels of gene flow. We also determined that genomic data can vastly improve our ability to assign individuals to their natal populations, even as they mix during migration, a finding that will assist management practices.

In contrast, hatchery releases were significantly correlated with Chinook productivity in only one of 20 populations. Our findings are consistent with recent research on predator diets and bioenergetics modeling that suggest there is a relationship between harbour seal predation on juvenile Chinook and reduced marine survival in parts of the eastern Pacific.

Previous work suggests that the mean size and age of some North American populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salmonidae) are declining. These trends are of concern because Chinook salmon are highly valued commercially for their exceptional size and because the loss of the largest and oldest individuals may lead to reduced population productivity. Using long-\-term data from wild and hatchery populations, we quantified changes in the demographic structure of Chinook salmon populations over the past four decades across the Northeast Pacific Ocean, from California through western Alaska. Our results show that wild and hatchery fish are becoming smaller and younger throughout most of the Pacific coast. Proportions of older age classes have decreased over time in most regions. Simultaneously, the length-\-at-\-age of older fish has declined while the length-a\- t-a\- ge of younger fish has typically increased. However, negative size trends of older ages were weak or non-\-existent at the southern end of the range. While it remains to be explored whether these trends are caused by changes in climate, fishing practices or species interactions such as predation, our qualitative review of the potential causes of demographic change suggests that selective removal of large fish has likely contributed to the apparent widespread declines in average body sizes.},

  abstract = {A central problem in understanding how species respond to global change is in parsing the effects of local drivers of population dynamics from regional and global drivers that are shared among populations. Management and conservation efforts that typically focus on a particular population would benefit greatly from being able to separate the effects of environmental processes at local, regional, and global scales. One way of addressing this challenge is to integrate data across multiple populations and use multivariate time series approaches to estimate shared and independent components of dynamics among neighboring populations. Here, we use a data set of 15 populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) covering a broad geographical range in the eastern North Pacific Ocean to show how Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) can be used to estimate temporal coherence in population dynamics and to detect environmental drivers across spatial scales. Our results show that productivity dynamics of Chinook salmon populations strongly covary at the regional scale, but to a lesser degree at larger spatial scales. The timing of river ice break-\-up in spring was identified as an important driver of regional productivity dynamics. In addition, broad-s\- cale variability in population productivity was linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, a dominant pattern of sea surface height variability. These broad-\-scale patterns in productivity dynamics may be associated with recent regime shifts in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. However, our results also demonstrate that populations within regions do not always respond consistently to the same environmental drivers, thus suggesting location-s\- pecific impacts. Overall, this study illustrates the use of DFA for quantifying the spatial and temporal complexity of multiple population responses to environmental change, thereby providing insights to processes that affect populations across large geographic areas, but that might be filtered by local habitat conditions.},

We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (-16\%), nutrient transport (-28\%), fisheries value (-21\%), and meals for rural people (-26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

There are multiple ways to calculate BRPs when biological parameters are time varying. Using summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a case study, we investigated time-varying approaches in concert with climate-linked population models to understand the impact of environmentally driven variability in natural mortality, recruitment, and size-at-age on two commonly used BRPs [B0(t) and F35\%(t)]. We used the following two approaches to calculate time-varying BRPs: dynamic-BRP and moving-average-BRP. We quantified the variability and uncertainty of different climate dependencies and estimation approaches, attributed BRP variation to variation in life-history processes, and evaluated how using different approaches impacts estimates of stock status. Results indicate that the dynamic-BRP approach using the climate-linked natural mortality model produced the least variable reference points compared to others calculated. Summer flounder stock status depended on the estimation approach and climate model used. These results emphasize that understanding climate dependencies is important for summer flounder reference points and perhaps other species, and careful consideration is warranted when considering what time-varying approach to use, ideally based upon simulation studies within a proposed set of management procedures.},

Vast numbers of hatchery-reared fish are released annually, ostensibly to restore/enhance wild populations or provide greater angling returns. While previous studies have shown that captive-bred fish perform poorly in the wild relative to wild-bred conspecifics, few have measured individual lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and how this affects population productivity. Here, we analyse data on Atlantic salmon from an intensely studied catchment into which varying numbers of captive-bred fish have escaped/been released and potentially bred over several decades. Using a molecular pedigree, we demonstrate that, on average, the LRS of captive-bred individuals was only 36\% that of wild-bred individuals. A significant LRS difference remained after excluding individuals that left no surviving offspring, some of which might have simply failed to spawn, consistent with transgenerational effects on offspring survival. The annual productivity of the mixed population (wild-bred plus captive-bred) was lower in years where captive-bred fish comprised a greater fraction of potential spawners. These results bolster previous empirical and theoretical findings that intentional stocking, or non-intentional escapees, threaten, rather than enhance, recipient natural populations.},

We present a novel method for fitting stock\textendash recruitment models using the Bayesian online change point detection algorithm, which is able to cope with sudden changes in the model parameters. We validate our method using simulations and apply it to empirical data of four demersal fishes in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We show that all of the stocks have experienced shifts in their recruitment dynamics that cannot be captured by a model that assumes time-invariant parameters. The detected shifts in the recruitment dynamics result in clearly different parameter distributions and recruitment predictions between the regimes. This study illustrates how stock\textendash recruitment relationships can experience shifts, which, if not accounted for, can lead to false predictions about a stock's recovery ability and resilience to fishing.},

Management agencies need to rapidly and reliably detect such changes to avoid costly suboptimal harvests or depletion of stocks. However, given the inherent variability of salmon populations, it is difficult to detect changes quickly, let alone forecast them. We therefore compared three methods of annually updating estimates of stock-recruitment parameters: standard linear regression, Walters' bias-corrected regression, and a Kalman filter. We used Monte Carlo simulations that hypothesized a wide range of future climate-induced changes in the Ricker a parameter of a salmon stock. We then used each parameter estimation method on the simulated stock and recruitment data and set escapement targets and harvest goals accordingly. In these situations with a time-varying true Ricker a parameter, Kalman filter estimation resulted in greater mean cumulative catch than was produced by the standard linear regression approach, Walters' bias correction method, or a fixed harvest rate policy. This benefit of the Kalman filter resulted from its better ability to track changing parameter values, thereby producing escapements closer to the optimal escapement each year. However, errors in implementing desired management actions can significantly reduce benefits from all parameter estimation techniques.},

This indicates that important environmental processes affecting variation in sockeye survival rate from spawners to recruits operate at regional spatial scales, rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. The observed covariation in survival rates of Bristol Bay stocks appears to be due to a combination of both freshwater and, to a greater degree, marine processes. Bristol Bay sockeye stocks showed a dramatic and persistent increase in survival rates coinciding with the abrupt changes in the North Pacific environment in the mid-1970s; however, there was little evidence of a similar response for Fraser River stocks.},

Previous research using numerous Monte Carlo simulation trials showed that a Kalman filter performed better than standard estimation techniques in detecting such trends in a timely manner. Therefore, we used historical data along with a Kalman filter that included a time-varying Ricker a parameter to reconstruct changes in productivity (recruits per spawner at a given spawner abundance) of eight Bristol Bay, Alaska, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks over the past 40 years. Productivity generally increased for most stocks but varied widely for others and dramatically decreased in another. Such large changes in productivity are important for management.

We found strong evidence of positive covariation among spawner-to-recruit survival rates of wild stocks within regions and between certain adjacent regions (e.g., correlations from 0.3 to 0.7) but little evidence of covariation between stocks of distant regions (e.g., separated by 1,000 km or more). Similarly, for hatchery stocks from Washington, British Columbia, and southeast Alaska, positive covariation in the indices of fry-to-recruit survival rate occurred only within regions and between certain adjacent regions. These patterns suggest that important environmental processes affecting interannual variation in spawner-to-recruit survival rates of chum salmon operate at local or regional spatial scales rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. These results are similar to our previous findings for sockeye salmon O. nerka and pink salmon O. gorbuscha and help identify the spatial characteristics of environmental variables required to improve forecasting models and better understand the effects of climatic changes on salmon productivity. Our finding that local or regional-scale processes primarily affect productivity differs from that of other studies, which suggest that large, ocean-basin-scale processes predominate. However, the latter studies were mostly based on time series of aggregate catch data, which provide limited spatial resolution and are potentially confounded by several factors.},

The size of the fish caught, s f all species, has decreased, but to different degrees and over different time periods, and for the most part this results from a size decrease in the population. These decreases do not exhibit significant correlations with available ocean temperature or salinity series, except that for sockeye lower temperature is associated with b g e r size. Chinook s d m w have decreased greatly in both size and age since the 1920s, most importantly because nonmaturing individuals are taken by the troll fishery; hence individuals that mature at older ages are harvested more intensively, which decreases the percentage of older ones available both directly and cumulatively because the spawners include an excess of younger fish. Other species have decreased in size principally since 1950, when the change to payment by the pound rather than by the piece made it profitable for the gill-netters to harvest more sf the larger fish. Cohos and pinks exhibit the greatest decreases, these being almost entirely a cumulative genetic effect caused by commercial trolls and gill nets removing fish of larger than average size. However, cohos reared in the Strait of Georgia have not decreased in size, possibly because sport trolling has different selection characteristics or because of the increase in the hatchery-reared component of the catch. The mean size of chum and sockeye salmon caught has changed much less than that of the sther species. Churns have the additional peculiarity that gill nets tend to take smaUer individuals than seines do and that their mean age has increased, at least between 1957 and 1972. That overall mean size baas nevertheless decreased somewhat may be related to the fact that yeaunger-maturing individuals grow much faster than older-maturing ones; hence excess removal of the smaller younger fish tends to depress growth rate. Among sockeye the decrease in size has apparently been retarded by an increase in growth rate related to the gradual cooling of the ocean since 1940. However, selection has had two important effects: zaaa increase in the percentage of age-3 "jacks" in some stocks, these being little harvested, and an increase in the diflerence in size between sockeye having t h e e and four ocean growing seasons. respectively.},

"Mechanism 2" is the fact that mixtures of stocks of unequal productivity, when harvested together, produce smaller recruitments than single stocks of the same original size and having the same optimum rate of exploitation. In addition, any fishery for a valuable species is likely to develop beyond the optimum rate of exploitation because there is no easily detectable symptom that the optimum is being passed. When this has happened, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) will not be achieved immediately if the optimum rate is imposed subsequent to a period of overexploitation; rather there will be a gradual approach to MSY that extends over several generations after the optimum rate is established. Both of the two mechanisms above, plus the likelihood of unrecognized overfishing, make for a catch maximum while fishing is still on the increase. For salmon this maximum is likely to be 30\textendash 60\% greater than the sustainable yield. In addition, unavoidable difficulties of management make for even greater differences between the historical maximum and the mean equilibrium yield that can be achieved in practice. Good annual prediction of recruitment can improve this picture because rate of exploitation can then be adjusted to the quantity of fish available; however this procedure too is much less effective when mixtures of stocks are fished in common, because in general the recruitments to different stocks do not vary in exactly the same way. The phenomena described may also contribute to an historical early maximum of catch in fisheries for species such as cod, being independent of and additional to the maximum caused by "removal of accumulated stock."},

Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the precautionary principle underpin many reference points. Non-proxy reference points based on MSY in age-based singlespecies assessments depend on the stock\textendash recruitment (SR) relationship, which can display complex variability. Current reference points ignore persistent dynamic change by assuming that the SR relationship is stationary and with constant recruitment parameters over selected time periods. We highlight Peterman's productivity method (PPM), which is capable of tracking temporal dynamics of recruitment productivity via time-varying SR parameters. We show how temporal variability in SR parameters affects fishing mortality and biomass MSY-based reference points. Implementation of PPM allows for integrated dynamic ecosystem influences in tactical management while avoiding overwrought and sometimes ephemeral mechanistic hypotheses tested on small and variable SR datasets. While some of these arguments have been made in individual papers, in our opinion the method has not yet garnered the attention that is due to it.},

  abstract = {Changes over time in age, sex, and length-at-age of returning Pacific salmon have been widely observed, suggesting concurrent declines in per capita reproductive output. Thus, assessment models assuming stationary reproductive output may inaccurately estimate biological reference points that inform harvest policies. We extended age-structured state-space spawner-recruit models to accommodate demographic time trends and fishery selectivity to investigate temporal changes in reference points using Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus tshawytscha}). We illustrate that observed demographic changes have likely reduced per capita reproductive output in an additive manner, for example, models including changes in both length-at-age or age composition showed larger declines than models incorporating only one time trend. Translated into biological reference points using a yield-per-recruit algorithm, we found escapement needed for maximum sustained catch has likely increased over time, but the magnitude further depended on size-selective harvest (i.e., larger changes for reference points based on larger mesh gillnets). Compared to traditional salmon assessments, our approach that acknowledges demographic time trends allows more complete use of available data and facilitates evaluating trade-offs among gear-specific harvest policies.},

  abstract = {The population dynamics of forage fish are often `boom or bust', and variation in recruitment may be a contributing factor to changes in abundance. Here we applied several methods for identifying stock recruit relationships (SRR) to 52 forage fish stocks: a time-invariant Ricker model and two time-varying methods (dynamic linear models and regime-based models). A positive relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment existed for 28 stocks, with 14 of those being best fit by a Ricker curve. Time-varying models were preferred for 26 stocks over a time-invariant Ricker curve. We also showed through simulation that spurious, yet significant stock-recruit relationships can be generated if recruitment was environmentally driven, the lag between recruitment and spawning biomass was small, and autocorrelation in recruitment was high\textemdash a combination of characteristics that many forage fish stocks display. Based on our results, observed time-invariant SRRs can result from a reversed causality of `boom and bust' dynamics in situations in which life histories are short (i.e., changes in recruitment are driving changes in spawning biomass). `Hidden' SRRs are also possible because of time-variation in SRR parameters. Understanding when each of these potential failings of fitting SRRs can occur is a key challenge in forage fish management.},

  abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic continental shelf is a large ecosystem undergoing rapid environmental changes, which are expected to modify the productivity of natural marine resources. Current management of most fished species assumes stationary production relationships or time-invariant recruitment rates. With linear state-space models, we examined the evidence of dynamic productivity for 25 stocks of the Northeast US shelf. We expanded the suite of options available within the state-space approach to produce robust estimates. Fifteen of the stocks exhibited time-varying productivity or changes in their maximum reproductive rate. Few productivity time series are related across the whole region, though adjacent stocks of the same species exhibited similar trends. Some links to region-wide environmental variables were observed. We demonstrate that fish recruitment can often be better predicted over a short-term horizon by accounting for dynamic productivity, which could be valuable for fisheries management. Improving predictions by incorporating environmental covariates or covariance among the stocks must be considered case by case and with caution, as their relationships may change over time.},

We developed a methodology including a Hidden Markov Stock-recruitment Model (HMSM), the maximum likelihood approach and a model selection procedure to identify abrupt changes of stock-recruitment (SR) dynamics. This method allows us to objectively identify the unobserved regimes, estimate regime-specific parameters, and predict the transition probabilities among regimes. First, we used simulation to verify that our method could identify the correct number of regimes and estimate the model parameters well. Then, we applied the models to an Atlantic cod stock on the southern Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada. Results indicated that the HMSM assuming 2 regimes performed the best, and the cod stock shifted to a regime characterized with lower productivity and higher density dependence in late 1980s.~Additionally, the estimated probability to return to the previous high-productivity regime was very low, suggesting the cod stock may remain at the low-productivity regime for a prolonged period. Overall, we consider the methodology proposed in this paper as a useful tool to model regime shifts of SRRs in fisheries stock assessment.},

Parameter estimation and dynamic optimization methods are combined for the Ricker stock-recruitment model to show how exploitation rates should be manipulated to give more information about the model parameters; in general, harvesting rates should be lower than would be predicted by the best fitting recruitment curve unless this curve predicts that the stock is very productive. A decision procedure is developed for comparing alternative stock-recruitment models; when applied to the Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), the procedure indicates that an experimental increase in escapements would be quite worthwhile. It appears that there is considerable promise for extending these methods and procedures to cases where the stock size is unknown and where fishing effort is poorly controlled.},

  abstract = {Stock assessment usually proceeds from the assumption that there are time-invariant relationships between stock size and rate processes such as recruitment, although such relationships are difficult to discern due to noise caused by factors other than stock size. There are good biological reasons not to trust this assumption in exploited populations, where persistent environmental changes and shifts in stock structure may cause various parameters to change. Graphical and statistical procedures can be used to detect this nonstationarity in historical data sets for which stock size has varied so as to repeatedly sample a range of sizes. The policy implications of nonstationarity depend on whether the changes are clearly observable as deviations from known, Song-term baseline responses. If the changes are observable, it is usually best to pretend that the current deviation will persist unless strong constraints on policy change make it necessary to plan for changes that may occur far into the future. If the changes are not observable (the usual case), then it is necessary to make a difficult policy choice between passively waiting for informative stock responses versus actively experimenting with harvest rates so as to quickly get information about responses over a range of stock sizes.},

  abstract = {Marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly at risk of large and cascading changes from multiple human activities (termed ``regime shifts''), which can impact population productivity, resilience, and ecosystem structure. Pacific salmon exhibit persistent and large fluctuations in their population dynamics driven by combinations of intrinsic (e.g., density dependence) and extrinsic factors (e.g., ecosystem changes, species interactions). In recent years, many Pacific salmon have declined due to regime shifts but clear understanding of the processes driving these changes remains elusive. Here, we unpacked the role of density dependence, ecosystem trends, and stochasticity on productivity regimes for a community of five anadromous Pacific salmonids (Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Pink Salmon, Dolly Varden, and Coastal Cutthroat Trout) across a rich 40-\-year time-\-series. We used a Bayesian multivariate state-\-space model to examine whether productivity shifts had similarly occurred across the community and explored marine or freshwater changes associated with those shifts. Overall, we identified three productivity regimes: an early regime (1976\textendash\-1990), a compensatory regime (1991\textendash\-2009), and a declining regime (since 2010) where large declines were observed for Steelhead, Dolly Varden, and Cutthroat Trout, intermediate declines in Coho and no change in Pink Salmon. These regime changes were associated with multiple cumulative effects across the salmon life cycle. For example, increased seal densities and ocean competition were associated with lower adult marine survival in Steelhead. Watershed logging also intensified over the past 40 years and was associated with (all else equal) {$\geq$}97\% declines in freshwater productivity for Steelhead, Cutthroat, and Coho. For Steelhead, marine and freshwater dynamics played approximately equal roles in explaining trends in total productivity. Collectively, these changing environments limited juvenile production and lowered future adult returns. These results reveal how changes in freshwater and marine environments can jointly shape population dynamics among ecological communities, like Pacific salmon, with cascading consequences to their resilience.},
