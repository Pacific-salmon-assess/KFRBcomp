# Introduction

Variability and declines in stock producvity is an increasing issue associated with Pacific salmon populations.
Methods for estimating time-varying productivity usually entails the use of covariates in the stock-recruitment curves or the use of state-space models with a random walk component on the productivity parameter of the recruitment curve (Peterman's productivity method, Silvar-Viladomiu 2022). 

The most common method for estimating time-varying productivity with the Peterman's productivity method is to apply a Kalman Filter with fixed-interval smoothing (Peterman papers). Harvey (1989) showed that the fixed-interval smoothing method gave the best estimates of the time-varying parameter as well as its variance parameter. However, more recently, other methods for estimation of state-space models are available, including methods that rely on Laplace approximations (e.g., TMB and ADMB) and mcmc methods (e.g., stan). The approaches that do not rely on the Kalman filter and fixed-interval smoothing are sometimes called the Recursive Bayes methods (Freshwater and CSAS.). Although these methodologies are used interchangeably, they have not been formally compared in the context of estimating time-varying productivity in stock-recruitment curves. 

Here we compare the performance of two estimators for time-varying productivity within Peterman's productivity method: the Kalman filter and the Recursive Bayes method implemented in TMB. 

```{r load, include=FALSE}
library(here)
library(TMB)
library(tmbstan)
library(cowplot)

source(here("code","dlm-wrapper.R"))
source(here("code","sim_eval_func.R"))


compile("../code/TMBmodels/Ricker_tva_Smax_ratiovar.cpp")
dyn.load(dynlib("../code/TMBmodels/Ricker_tva_Smax_ratiovar"))


ao <- 2.5
b<-1/30000

```

# Methods

In order to compare the estimates we designed a simple simulation exercise in which data was simulate based on a Ricker curve over 100 years. In the last 50 years of the time-series the productivity parameter varied following four scenarios: random walk, decline, sine and regime. 
Add equations

The las 40 years in the time series were used as input to the estimation models: Kalman Filter, linear model  and, recursive Bayes. The Kalman filter was implemented within the dlm R package. The recursive Bayes model was implemented in TMB. A simple time-invariant linear model was also implemented for comparison purposes

# Findings
Time-varying models are more accurate and precise than the simple linear model
 
The comparison of the estimation methods showed extremely similar results for the estimate sof alphs and Smax generated with the Kalman filter and the Recursive bayes models. 

The standard deviation estimates were less biased for the recursive Bayes model. 

Pattern in distribution of the estimates did not chane across scenarios.
